// above is the console to print in console page of browser.


// Variables can be Declared in JS using "var", "let", "const"
// after 2015 we got ES6 from JS, Where we can use var, let & const?

// Ans :- "var" : we shouldnot use var bcz this will allow to declare same variables multiple times, which may lead to errors in code.
// have practice to use always "let" & "const".
// bcz "let" variable will not allow to declare same variables multiple times, and it allows to change the values.
// "const" will not allow to change value of a variable.
